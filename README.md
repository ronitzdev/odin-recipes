## Introduction

Welcome to **Odin Recipes**, a project designed to test and showcase my HTML skills. This project is part of my learning and development journey in web development, specifically through The Odin Project curriculum. Throughout this project, I have focused on learning and applying various fundamental HTML tags, as well as handling images, links, HTML attributes, and ensuring good practices for privacy and security when using links.

### Learning Objectives

In this project, I have worked on the following key aspects of web development:

#### Basic Structure
- Understanding and implementing the basic structure of an HTML document, including the use of `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- Utilizing the `<title>` tag to set the title of the web page, and including meta tags for character set and viewport settings for responsive design.

#### Text Tags
- Utilizing tags such as `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` to structure and format the textual content of web pages.
- Creating ordered and unordered lists using the `<ol>` and `<ul>` tags and their `<li>` elements.

#### Images
- Inserting images using the `<img>` tag, understanding the importance of the `src` and `alt` attributes for accessibility and SEO.
- Adjusting the size and alignment of images to enhance the visual presentation of content.

#### Links
- Creating internal and external links with the `<a>` tag, using the `href` attribute to specify URLs.
- Implementing navigation links within the website to improve usability and user experience.
- Using the `rel="noopener"` and `rel="noreferrer"` attributes on external links to enhance security and privacy, preventing linked pages from accessing link origin information and protecting against reverse tabnabbing attacks.

#### HTML Attributes
- Understanding and using various HTML attributes to enhance the functionality and accessibility of HTML elements.
- Applying attributes such as `id`, `class`, `title`, and `style` to customize and control the behavior and appearance of elements.

### Project Description

The **Odin Recipes** project involves creating a simple yet comprehensive recipe website. Each recipe page is structured and styled using the skills I have learned, presenting well-organized and visually appealing content. Through this project, I have been able to consolidate my knowledge of HTML and practice key concepts fundamental to web development.

### Security and Privacy Best Practices

In this project, I have also learned and applied best practices to improve security and privacy when handling external links:

- **`rel="noopener"`**: Prevents the linked page from accessing the `window.opener` object of the origin page, mitigating security risks such as reverse tabnabbing attacks.
- **`rel="noreferrer"`**: Prevents the linked page from receiving information about the origin page, enhancing user privacy when navigating between sites.

These attributes are essential to ensure that external links do not compromise the security and privacy of users.
