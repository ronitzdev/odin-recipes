      <h2>Description:</h2>
      <p>
        This is a classic Italian potato salad that can be found on tables from
        the north to the south. Meaning "parsley potatoes", you'll find Patate
        Prezzemolate everywhere in Italy: formal luncheons, family
        get-togethers, weeknight dinners, and even in school cafeterias. Buon
        appetito!
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>25 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and slightly crushed</li>
        <li>2 green onions (white part only), chopped</li>
        <li>Â½ cup very finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
      <p>
        Combine potatoes and salt in a large pot filled with cold water. Bring
        to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender, but not mushy, about 10
        minutes depending on size. Drain and set aside until cool enough to
        handle.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
      <p>
        While potatoes are cooking, whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil and white wine
        vinegar together in a small bowl. Add garlic and set aside.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
      <p>
        Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine
        potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl and lightly toss. Season
        with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss,
        taking care not to break the potatoes.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
      <p>
        Top with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and red pepper flakes right
        before serving.
